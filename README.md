# timeSpacePractice (Alston and Tyler) - 01/09/2024

Work with a partner for this exercise. Have one partner fork the repo and invite the other partner as a collaborator. Both clone, and follow the git cycle of pulling and pushing.

Commit frequently! BOTH PARTNERS MUST CONTRIBUTE COMMITS! Alternate which computer you are working on.

In `Practice.java` fill in the time and space complexities for the already completed methods. Implement the unimplemented methods AND ADD UNIT TESTS for them in `PracticeTest.java`.

When you are finished, one partner should make a PR against the original repository. BOTH PARTNERS MUST COPY THE SAME PR LINK TO CANVAS TO GET CREDIT.
